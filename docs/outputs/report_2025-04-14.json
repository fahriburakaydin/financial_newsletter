    "summary": "**TLDR: Key Market Insights for April 15, 2025**  \n\n- **Trade Tensions Spike**: China halted Boeing jet deliveries due to new 125% U.S. tariffs, causing Boeing shares to drop 3.5%. Retaliatory measures threaten global supply chains and manufacturing sectors[1].  \n\n- **Earnings Highlights**:  \n  - **Bank of America**: Beat Q1 forecasts with $0.90 EPS (+18% YoY) and $27.4B revenue (+6% YoY), driven by trading gains and resilient consumer spending. Shares rose 2% premarket[1][2][3].  \n  - **Johnson & Johnson**: Raised 2025 sales guidance to $91B\u2013$91.8B after strong Q1 results ($2.77 EPS vs. $2.56 estimate), though shares dipped 1% on profit-taking[1].  \n\n- **Market Moves**:  \n  - **Equities**: S&P 500 (-0.09%) and Dow (-0.3%) retreated after tariff-relief rallies, while Nasdaq held flat. Financials (+4%) and tech (Palantir +5.36%) outperformed[1][3].  \n  - **Crypto**: Bitcoin stabilized near $84.5K amid Fed rate-cut speculation. Solana (+1.65%) led gains, fueled by memecoin activity[1].  \n\n- **Macro Risks**:  \n  - U.S. tariffs could reduce 2025 GDP by $180B annually and raise consumer prices by 2.3%.  \n  - Fed signals potential rate cuts as inflation cools (April CPI forecast: 2.5% YoY)[1].  \n\n- **Stocks to Watch**:  \n  - **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Bearish short-term trend despite strong AI/cloud growth prospects (12.35% FY2025 revenue forecast)[1].  \n  - **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: Mixed analyst sentiment on $500B AI infrastructure plan, with technicals pointing to bearish momentum[1].  \n\n- **Upcoming Catalysts**:  \n  - April 16: China GDP data, U.S. retail sales, ECB meeting.  \n  - April 17: ECB policy decision, Fed manufacturing survey.  \n  - Earnings: Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Netflix later in the week[1].  \n\n**Why it matters**: Markets balance tariff risks against resilient corporate earnings, with central bank policies and trade developments likely to drive volatility."
