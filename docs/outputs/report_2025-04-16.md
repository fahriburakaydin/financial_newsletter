## Macro-Economic Landscape üè¶

#### Central Bank Policy

#### Recent Economic Indicators

- **Q4 2024 GDP:** +2.4% annualized ‚Äî Consumer spending (+4.2%) and government expenditures drove growth

- **Consumer Sentiment:** 64.7 (Feb 2025) ‚Äî 9.8% monthly decline due to tariff price fears



#### Risks & Opportunities

- Risk: Tariffs projected to reduce 2025 GDP by 0.9pp and cause $3,800 annual household consumer losses

- Opportunity: Strong consumer spending (+4.2% Q4 2024) despite headwinds



### EU

#### Economic Conditions

- **Growth:** 2025 forecast cut to <1% due to US tariffs offsetting defense spending gains

- **Inflation:** Core inflation projected at 1.8% year-over-year

- **Employment:** Unemployment expected to rise to 6.5% from record low 6.2%


#### Central Bank Policy

- **Current Rate:** 2.5%
