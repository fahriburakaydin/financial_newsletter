## Market Reaction Summary üîç

Tech strength propelled indices despite trade uncertainty, with Alphabet and Tesla offsetting weak performers. Absence of commodity/crypto data suggests focus remained on equity markets. Sentiment remains bifurcated - bullish on tech innovation but cautious about escalating tariffs and earnings misses in traditional sectors.


### Indices

**Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI):** +0.03% at 40,103.89

Marginal gain driven by mixed sector performance, with Technology (+7.16%) and Consumer Discretionary (+6.96%) leading, while Health Care (-2.06%) lagged. Trade tensions from Trump's tariff remarks created headwinds.


**Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC):** +1.26% at 17,382.94

Tech-driven rally fueled by Alphabet's dividend announcement (+1.5%) and Tesla's 9.8% surge on autonomous vehicle regulation progress. Outperformed other indices with YTD gains of 6% this week.


**S&P 500 (^GSPC):** +0.72% at 5,524.06

Fourth consecutive gain led by Magnificent Seven members, though down 6.06% YTD. Intel's weak guidance (-7%) and T-Mobile's subscriber miss (-11%) limited upside.

## Macro-Economic Landscape üè¶

### US

#### Economic Conditions

- **Growth:** Real GDP growth projected to decline by 0.5 percentage points in 2025 due to tariff impacts, with consumer spending growth slowing to 1.7%

- **Inflation:** Price level increased 2.3% from tariffs, with business inflation expectations rising to 2.8% in April

- **Employment:** Unemployment rate at 4.1% in early 2025, forecast to rise to 4.5% in 2026

- **Recent Decision:** Forecast to cut rates by 0.25pp in July, September, and December 2025

- **Outlook:** Additional 0.5pp cuts expected in 2026, balancing tariff impacts with expansionary fiscal policy


#### Recent Economic Indicators

- **Composite Output Index:** Slowest growth since December 2023 ‚Äî Indicates marked slowing of business activity growth

- **New Home Sales:** +7.4% year-over-year (March) ‚Äî Supported by declining mortgage rates and low existing inventory

- Risk: Margin compression reported as businesses struggle to pass tariff costs to consumers

- Opportunity: Expansionary fiscal policy expected to partially cushion economic slowdown



### Global Outlook

US economic turbulence dominates global concerns, with aggressive tariffs creating cross-border trade uncertainties and inflationary pressures. Missing data for EU/China/Sweden limits full analysis, but US policy decisions are likely influencing international markets through currency fluctuations (dollar depreciation) and Treasury yield spreads
