## Macro-Economic Landscape üè¶

### US

#### Economic Conditions

- **Inflation:** Expected to rise to 4.0% year-over-year by Q2 2026 due to tariff impacts

- **Employment:** Unemployment rate forecast to rise from 4.1% in early 2025 to 4.5% average in 2026


#### Central Bank Policy

- **Employment:** Labor market deterioration contributing to growth slowdown


#### Central Bank Policy

- **Current Rate:** Maintained accommodative stance

- **Recent Decision:** Implementing measures to strengthen private consumption

### Global Outlook

Global growth faces headwinds from US-China trade tensions and synchronized monetary policy adjustments. The US tariff shock (implemented April 2025) has created cross-border growth risks, particularly for export-dependent economies like China. While central banks attempt to balance inflation control with growth preservation, political uncertainty and protectionist measures dominate the risk landscape. Coordinated policy responses remain critical to avoid global recessionary pressures.
