<br>
- **Market Moves**:  <br>
  - **Equities**: S&P 500 (-0.09%) and Dow (-0.3%) retreated after tariff-relief rallies, while Nasdaq held flat. Financials (+4%) and tech (Palantir +5.36%) outperformed[1][3].  <br>

<br>
- **Macro Risks**:  <br>
  - U.S. tariffs could reduce 2025 GDP by $180B annually and raise consumer prices by 2.3%.  <br>

  - **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Bearish short-term trend despite strong AI/cloud growth prospects (12.35% FY2025 revenue forecast)[1].  <br>

<br>
- **Upcoming Catalysts**:  <br>

  - April 17: ECB policy decision, Fed manufacturing survey.  <br>
  - Earnings: Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Netflix later in the week[1].  <br>
